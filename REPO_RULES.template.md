# Repository Rules — <PROJECT_NAME>

> **How to use this template:** Copy it to your new repo's root as `REPO_RULES.md`.
> Replace every `<PLACEHOLDER>`. Delete sections that don't apply. Anything not in
> angle brackets is a sane default you can keep as-is.

These rules keep the repo clean, reproducible, and safe to share. They apply to every
commit, branch, and pull request. When in doubt, favor the simplest change that keeps
the project working.

---

## 1. Scope & structure

- Describe the intended shape of the project in one or two lines, so drift is obvious:
  <e.g. "a single CLI entry point under `src/`", "a Next.js app", "a Python package">.
- Keep the layout predictable. Sketch the top-level structure:

  ```
  <repo>/
  ├─ <main source location>
  ├─ <dependency manifest>   # e.g. requirements.txt / package.json / go.mod
  ├─ README.md               # what it is + how to run it (for humans)
  ├─ AGENTS.md               # always-on rules — the single source of truth all agents follow
  ├─ CLAUDE.md               # Claude Code entry point (imports AGENTS.md)
  ├─ GEMINI.md               # Antigravity entry point (points at AGENTS.md)
  ├─ .cursor/rules/          # Cursor entry point (points at AGENTS.md)
  ├─ REPO_RULES.md           # this file — the full rationale
  ├─ PRD.md                  # project brief — what we're building and why (project-level)
  ├─ WORKLOG.md              # dated running log of what changed (project memory)
  ├─ SPEC.md                 # current feature's plan (optional, per-feature)
  ├─ lefthook.yml            # pre-commit checks (secret scan, etc.)
  ├─ .claude/                # hooks + settings that enforce these rules
  └─ .gitignore
  ```

- Don't restructure the project without updating this section first.

### One rule set, many agents

`AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth. Each agent reads a different filename, so the others
are thin pointers to it — whichever agent picks up the project reads the same rules before
touching code:

| Agent | Reads | In this repo |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` (native) | reads it directly |
| Cursor | `AGENTS.md` (native) + `.cursor/rules/` | direct, plus an always-apply `.cursor/rules/agents.mdc` pointer |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` |
| Antigravity | `GEMINI.md` (+ `AGENTS.md` on v1.20.3+) | `GEMINI.md` points at `AGENTS.md` |

Edit `AGENTS.md` for any rule change; leave the pointers alone unless an agent needs a
tool-specific override.

## 2. What MUST NEVER be committed

Generated, machine-local, private, or large files belong in `.gitignore`, never in history:

- **Secrets** — no `.env`, API keys, tokens, or credentials in code, config, or commit
  messages. Commit a `*.example` template instead when a reference is useful.
- **Dependencies / build output** — vendored deps, `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `build/`, `dist/`.
- **Large binaries / data** — model files, datasets, media dumps, anything re-downloadable.
- **Local state** — log files, caches, user-specific config, scratch files.
- **Editor / OS cruft** — `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`.

If one slips in by accident, see §7.

### Starter `.gitignore`

Use the ready-made `gitignore.template` from this template set (copy it to `.gitignore`),
which covers secrets, dependencies, build output, local state, and editor/OS cruft. Adjust
per project. Commit it **first**, before any code, so ignored files never enter history.

---

## 3. Version control

### Setup
- Initialize once with `git init` and commit `.gitignore` **first**, before any code,
  so ignored files never enter history.
- `main` is the default branch and is always in a working state.

### Branching
- **Never commit directly to `main`.** Branch for every change.
- Branch naming: `<type>/<short-desc>` — `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`, `refactor/`.
  - `feat/add-export`, `fix/null-on-empty-input`, `docs/readme-setup`
- Delete branches after they merge.
- *(Optional but recommended)* enforce it with a hook that blocks `git commit`/`git push`
  on `main`. See `block-main-git.template.ps1` in this template set.

### Commits
- One logical change per commit. Small and reviewable.
- Imperative, present-tense subject, ≤ 72 chars, no trailing period.
  - ✅ `fix: restore focus after dialog closes`   ❌ `fixed some stuff`
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) prefixes:
  `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`.
- Commit body explains **why**, not just what.
- Never commit broken code to `main`. Never `git push --force` to `main`.
- Don't rewrite published history others may have pulled.

### Pull requests
- All changes reach `main` through a PR, even solo work — it's the review checkpoint.
- PR description states: what changed, why, and how it was tested.
- Keep PRs focused. A bug fix and a refactor are two PRs.
- A PR must build / run / pass tests before merge.

### Plan before you code

- For anything beyond a one-line edit, write a short plan **before** implementing: which
  files change, what's explicitly out of scope, and how the result will be verified.
- For a real feature, copy `SPEC.template.md` to `SPEC.md` and fill it in. The spec — not the
  code — is the thing to review and agree on first. Keep it updated as decisions change.
- This matters most with AI agents: without an explicit plan and scope, an agent fills the
  gaps with guesses and confidently builds the wrong thing.

### Prove it works (verification)

- "Looks done" is not done. Before calling a task complete, produce evidence: test output,
  the exact command run and what it returned, or a screenshot — not just an assertion.
- Prefer a check the tool can run itself (test suite, build, linter) so mistakes are caught
  automatically instead of waiting for a human to notice them.

## 3a. Automatic git & guardrails (enforcement)

Git is hands-off. Whichever agent picks up the project runs the whole workflow itself — branch,
commit, push, open PR — without prompting you. The pipeline **stops at opening the PR**; merging
into `main` stays a deliberate step.

Written rules are only advice; an agent (or a tired human) forgets them. The rules that
actually hold are the ones a machine enforces. This kit layers guardrails so that if one is
bypassed, another still catches the problem ("defense in depth").

**Git-level guardrails (apply to EVERY agent + manual commits — via `lefthook.yml`):**
- **Branch guard** — refuses any commit made on `main`/`master`. Branch first.
- **Secret scan on commit** — Gitleaks refuses any commit containing a key, token, or
  password. This is the safety net behind §6.
- Install both once with `lefthook install`.

**Claude Code-specific guardrails (via `.claude/settings.json` hooks — convenience for Claude):**
- **Branch guard** — `block-main-git.ps1` denies commit/push on `main` early, before the
  git-level check even runs.
- **Auto-commit on turn end** — `auto-commit.ps1` (Stop hook) commits and pushes any leftover
  work so nothing is lost. Never touches `main`; the secret scan still gates its commits.
- **Protected paths** — `protect-paths.ps1` blocks edits to sensitive files/folders.
- Other agents (Codex, Cursor, Antigravity) rely on the git-level guardrails above plus the
  rules they read from `AGENTS.md`; replicate any of these in their own hook systems if wanted.

**Optional:** a CI workflow re-runs tests and the secret scan on every push, catching anything
that slipped past local checks.

Set these up at project start. Do not disable or route around a guardrail to "get unblocked" —
fix the underlying cause (branch first, remove the secret, etc.).

---

## 4. Dependencies

- Pin versions for reproducibility (`==`, lockfiles, etc.).
- Adding a dependency requires a one-line justification in the PR. Remove anything unused.
- State any hard constraints here: <e.g. "no cloud SDKs", "no telemetry", "local-only",
  "stdlib only", "no new outbound network calls">.

---

## 5. Code hygiene

- Match the existing style and comment density. Don't reformat untouched code in a feature PR.
- No dead code, no commented-out blocks, no debug-print spam left behind.
- Preserve the project's core invariants: <list the load-bearing guarantees your project
  must never break — e.g. "single source of truth for config", "no blocking calls on the UI thread">.

---

## 6. Secrets & privacy (hard line)

- No secret ever enters the repo — not in code, config, history, or a commit message.
- Before pushing, scan the diff for keys, tokens, paths with usernames, and device serials.
- State the network policy: <e.g. "local-only; any PR adding an outbound call is rejected
  unless this rule is changed first", or "external calls allowed to <approved hosts> only">.
- If a secret is ever committed, treat it as compromised: rotate it immediately, then scrub
  history (§7). Scrubbing alone is not enough — the key is burned.

---

## 7. When something bad gets committed

- **Large file** committed by mistake: remove it, add to `.gitignore`, and if already pushed,
  purge it from history with `git filter-repo` (preferred) or BFG, then force-update the
  remote *branch* (never `main`) and have collaborators re-clone.
- **Secret** committed: rotate the secret first (assume it's leaked), then scrub history as above.

---

## 8. Releases / tags (optional)

- Tag working milestones with semantic versions: `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`.
- A tagged commit must satisfy <your definition of "shippable">.

---

*These rules protect three things: a repo small enough to clone fast, a history clean of
secrets and binaries, and a project that still matches its intended shape. Change the rule
before you break it.*
