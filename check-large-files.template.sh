Large files bloat the clone forever -- git keeps every version of them, and removing one
later means rewriting history for everybody.

Do one of these instead:
  * It is generated or downloadable -> add it to .gitignore and unstage it:
      git restore --staged <file>
  * It is real project data that must be versioned -> use Git LFS, or store it outside
    the repo and commit a small pointer/checksum.
  * The limit is genuinely wrong for this project -> raise it deliberately:
      git config governance.maxFileKB <number>
    and say why in the PR. Do not pass --no-verify.
